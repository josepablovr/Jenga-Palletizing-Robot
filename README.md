# Palletizing Robot

Welcome to the **Palletizing Robot** project! This is a **4 DOF robot** thatâ€™s got a little bit of everything: precision, automation, and repurposed hardware from an old printer (yes, really!). It uses **3 prismatic actuators** and a **rotational joint** in the end effector to perform an efficient pick-and-place operation.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

### The Mechanics
- **3 Prismatic Actuators**: These are powered by **DC motors with encoders**, each controlled by an optimized **PID controller** in **Arduino**. The cool part? **Interrupts** handle position updates without delay. So no waiting around for your robot to make its move.
- **1 Rotational Joint**: This gives the robot the ability to rotate and pick up items with precision.

**Note**: The actuators and sensors were repurposed from an old printerâ€”donâ€™t let your recycling pile go to waste, folks! These components can still do cool stuff when given a second chance.

### Control System
This isnâ€™t your typical robot with a joystick or complicated software interface. The robot is controlled by a set of **physical buttons**. The magic behind it is a **finite state machine (FSM)** that governs the robotâ€™s state, meaning you can **Start**, **Pause**, **Stop**, or **Restart** the robot with zero delays. Yep, everything happens in real time.

### Pick-and-Place: Itâ€™s Preprogrammed
The robot is set up with a **predefined pick-and-place sequence**, and here's the cool part:
- Fixed **starting position** and **target angle**.
- It calculates the **positions of 6 pallets** from these fixed parameters.
So, all you need to do is press a button, and the robot gets to workâ€”no guessing or recalibration.

### No Delays, Just Action
The code is designed with **no delays**â€”everything runs based on internal logic. That means the robot is always ready to move, no blocking code in the way. The pick-and-place operation flows seamlessly from start to finish.

### Setup
1. **Compile the code** into your **Arduino Mega**.
2. Hook up the motors, encoders, L298N motor drivers, and buttons.
3. Plug in your **24V power supply** and fire it up!

## Whatâ€™s Next? (Future Improvements)

Sadly, this project has been **abandoned** (the robot got disassembled ðŸ˜¢), but the code is still golden and could be adapted to other projects. If you want to take this robot to the next level, here are some ideas:

- **Cartesian Trajectory Planning**: Imagine the robot moving all 3 axes at the same time. That would make pick-and-place even smoother and more efficient.
- **Class-based PID Controls**: Tidy up the PID control code with classes to keep everything organized and easier to manage.
- **Speed and Acceleration Limits**: Add limits to speed and acceleration to prevent any mishaps like dropping your precious cargo.

## Why Bother?

This project shows that even old, seemingly useless hardware (like printers) can be turned into something useful and fun. Itâ€™s perfect for anyone interested in robotics, automation, and reusing components creatively.

The code is fast, efficient, and doesn't rely on delaysâ€”ideal for real-time control systems. So, take this as a reference, make it your own, and who knows? You might just take this palletizing robot to new heights.

Let the robot do the workâ€”no delays, just precision.

Enjoy!
