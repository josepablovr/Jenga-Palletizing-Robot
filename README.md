# Palletizing Robot

Welcome to the **Palletizing Robot** project! This is a **4 DOF robot** that combines precision, automation, and repurposed hardware from an old printer (yes, really!). It uses **3 prismatic actuators** and a **rotational joint** in the end effector to perform efficient pick-and-place operations.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

### The Mechanics
- **3 Prismatic Actuators**: These are driven by **DC motors with encoders**, each controlled by an optimized **PID controller** in **Arduino**. The standout feature? **Interrupts** handle position updates without delay, ensuring the robot responds immediately.
- **1 Rotational Joint**: This allows the robot to rotate and pick up items with high precision.
- **Personalized Gripper**: DC actuated gripper built for picking up Jenga pieces.

**Note**: The actuators and sensors came from old printers meant for recycling.

### Control System
This robot doesn't rely on a joystick or complex software interface. Instead, it is controlled via a set of **physical buttons**. The core of the control system is a **finite state machine (FSM)** that governs the robotâ€™s operations, so you can easily **Start**, **Pause**, **Stop**, or **Restart** the robot without any delays.

### Pick-and-Place: Itâ€™s Preprogrammed
The robot operates with a **predefined pick-and-place sequence**, which simplifies the task:
- A fixed **starting position** and **target angle**.
- It calculates the **positions of 6 pallets** based on these fixed parameters.
Just press a button, and the robot will execute the sequenceâ€”no recalibration needed.

### No Delays, Just Action
The system is built to work with **no delays**. Everything runs based on internal logic, meaning the robot is always ready to move, and thereâ€™s no blocking code. The pick-and-place operation runs smoothly from start to finish.

### Setup
1. **Compile the code** onto your **Arduino Mega**.
2. Connect the motors, encoders, L298N motor drivers, and buttons.
3. Plug in your **24V power supply** and the robot is ready to go!

## Whatâ€™s Next? (Future Improvements)

Although this project has been **abandoned** (the robot was disassembled ðŸ˜¢), the code remains highly functional and could be adapted for future projects. Here are some ideas for enhancing the robot:

- **Cartesian Trajectory Planning**: Moving all 3 axes simultaneously would make the pick-and-place sequence even more fluid and efficient.
- **Class-based PID Controls**: Refactoring the PID control logic into classes would improve code organization and maintainability.
- **Speed and Acceleration Limits**: Introducing speed and acceleration limits could prevent issues like dropping items during operation.

## Why It Matters

This project demonstrates that even old hardware, like printers, can be repurposed into functional robotic systems. Itâ€™s an excellent starting point for anyone interested in robotics, automation, and sustainable practices through creative reuse of components.

The code is fast, efficient, and designed to run without delaysâ€”making it perfect for real-time control applications. Use this as a reference, customize it for your own needs, and who knows? You might take this palletizing robot to the next level.

Let the robot do the workâ€”precisely and without interruption.

Enjoy!
